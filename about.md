Some information about you!

### More Information

I've always been interested in computers, at an early age I borrowed a book from the library called 'DOS for Dummies' and I devoured it immediately. I was in love with playing around with files, hiding them, moving them around, the most basic functions you can imagine.

Eventually I got into Bulletin Board Systems (BBSing) playing text-based ASCII art laden games like Legend of the Red Dragon.

By the time I graduated from high school I'd developed a love for programming and computer animation. At a strange pivotal point in my life I applied for the Engineering Physics program at Queen's University, and got accepted to one of the most difficult programs they offered.

I promptly both of my introductory Physics courses and took a 180 into the world of Mining Engineering.
